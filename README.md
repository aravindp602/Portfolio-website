## ‚ú® Key Features

This portfolio is more than just a static page; it's a demonstration of modern front-end development techniques.

-   **Interactive Custom Cursor:** A smooth, interactive cursor that provides a premium browsing experience.
-   **Draggable Project Carousel:** An intuitive, app-like carousel to browse projects with both button navigation and drag-to-scroll functionality.
-   **Light/Dark Theme:** A theme toggle that respects user preference and saves the choice in local storage.
-   **Dynamic Animations:**
    -   Hero section features a "typing" effect using `Typed.js`.
    -   Elements gracefully fade and slide in on scroll, powered by the `IntersectionObserver` API.
    -   Project cards feature a 3D tilt effect on hover using `Vanilla-Tilt.js`.
-   **AJAX Contact Form:** A contact form that submits data asynchronously to Formspree, providing instant feedback without a page reload.

## üöÄ Running Locally

To run this project on your local machine, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites
-   A modern web browser.
-   A local web server to properly handle file paths. The [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension for VS Code is a great option.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/aravindp602/portfolio.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd portfolio
    ```

3.  **Open `index.html`:**
    -   If you have a local server extension like Live Server, right-click on `index.html` and choose "Open with Live Server".
    -   Alternatively, you can simply open the `index.html` file directly in your browser.

## üí° Key Learnings & Challenges

-   **Performance-Driven Animations:** Implementing animations with `IntersectionObserver` and `requestAnimationFrame` to ensure they are smooth and don't degrade performance.
-   **Complex State Management with Vanilla JS:** Building features like the theme toggle and active nav link highlighting required careful management of state without a larger framework.
-   **Creating a Seamless User Experience:** Integrating multiple interactive elements (custom cursor, preloader, animations) to work together harmoniously without feeling cluttered was a key focus.
